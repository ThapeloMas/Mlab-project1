        <p class="paragraph">
            ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Thapelo Mashao, a passionate 25-year-old with a deep interest in web development. My journey in the world of technology began when I pursued Computer Sciences at North West University. Although I didn't finish the program, I left with just one module remaining. During my time at North West University, I did computer science, exploring the foundations of programming, algorithms, and software development methodologies. It was during this period that I discovered my fascination with web development. Driven by my curiosity and eagerness to learn, I embarked on a journey to sharpen my skills in web development. I immersed myself in online courses, tutorials, and hands-on projects, constantly pushing the boundaries of my knowledge and expertise. Today, I stand as a self taught web developer, learning wfront-end and back-end technologies. From crafting responsive and intuitive user interfaces to building robust server-side applications, I find joy in every aspect of the web development process. Outside of coding, you can find me exploring the latest trends in technology, indulging in outdoor adventures, or simply enjoying a good book. I'm always eager to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts, collaborate on exciting projects, and continue growing in this ever-evolving field. Let's connect and embark on this journey of innovation together!
